 * This code is just a simple demonstration of how you can use a rotary encoder
 * with software debounce. Note, that the debounce is only used when waiting for
 * the first event (pin change), not the second. This implementation is,
 * however, straight forward and left as an exercise for the reader/user. ;-)
